COLIN:
So Jim, what are we doing here today?

JIM:
What am I not working on?
Is that what it is?

COLIN:
So Jim, what are you working on today?

JIM:
What are we not working on?

COLIN:
So Jim, what are you working on today?

JIM:
What am I not working on today?
Tonight, we're working on Space Cop's headquarters.
At the very top of Space Cop's headquarters is a sort of Daily Planet-designed planet with a ring going around it.
When I initially built this, uh, I used a plastic ball and spray-painted it and had this cardboard disc going around it.
But the disc looks like crap.
So we decided to make a new sort of, uh, Saturn-like planet on the top of Space Cop's headquarters...out of something a little more special.

COLIN:
Mm!
Since we're all big fans of Indiana Jones and the...Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, we thought we'd honored the film by building it into the police headquarters.
To the power tools!

JIM:
Wow!
What kind of drill bit do you have there, Colin?

COLIN:
Milwaukee.

JIM:
Excellent.

COLIN:
There we go.
Kingdom of Crystal Skull in Space Cop.
