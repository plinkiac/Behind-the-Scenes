so Jim
what are we doing here today
what am I not working on
is that what it is
so Jim
what are you working on today
what are we not working on
so Jim
what are you working on today
what am I not working on today
tonight we're working on space cop's headquarters
at the very top of space cops headquarters is a sort of Daily Planet-designed planet with a ring going around it
when I initially built this uh I used a plastic ball and spray-painted it and had this cardboard disc going around it
but the disc looks like crap
so we decided to make a new sort of uh saturn-like planet on the top of space cop's headquarters out of something a little more special
mm
since we're all big fans of Indiana Jones New Kingdom of the Crystal Skull we thought we'd honored the film by building it into the police headquarters
to the power tools
Wow
what kind of drill bit do you have there, colin
Milwaukee
excellent
there we go
kingdom of Crystal Skull in space cop
