Organizing Our Movie Collection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=folpZj0ORf0

so, over the years, people have asked us about our movie collections, and our shelves and how we organize things
and so we thought we'd make a little video about that
and the first thing because i know people have commented about this but if you look at our shelves right now people say oh they look so empty are they are they throwing stuff away are they moving are they closing down
none of that's true but what we're doing now that makes them look a little more barren is that they used to be uh the tapes were front facing
and now to make room for more tapes because it's never ending we turned them to the spines
so it was nice
having them front facing and had that
sort of video store kind of aesthetic to
it
but they also fell over very easily
i thought the wall was a lot closer to
me than it was
so now they're they're spine facing and
uh that
has made tons of room for more more
garbage
the shelves themselves were built by me
rich usually does the the building and
carpentry stuff but for whatever reason
i built these
and the shelves are very basic they're
just one by fours that we painted black
i think the very first shelf uh was
built by mike
maybe is this the very first shelf yeah
wow if you look at the like the first
couple best of the worst episodes
there's just this one shelf yeah and
then we built
this one after that magically a second
shelf
uh showed up and then that filled up
very quickly
and it's just kind of been from there we
built another shelf then another shell
but another shelf
we had to keep expanding you wouldn't
believe how many tapes we get sent in
the mail every
every week i i i i get like
probably two bins like this we haven't
even had a po box listed in over
a year
up until recently our organization was
basically just separating by genre
so we have a whole wall of sci-fi and
fantasy
we have one wall for horror usually the
first part
of science fiction i've got like our
fantasy stuff and it's all
you know like movies with these
beautiful i don't know
like frank frank rosetta inspired kind
of barbarian fantasy covers
so one thing that i've noticed the
longer we've been doing this the more
stuff
no matter how obscure or uh unknown it
is to us
they just keep coming out on blu-ray uh
half of this stuff
when we first started getting them were
completely out of print and impossible
to find
and like 50 of them are released by
vinegar syndrome now
grave secrets on blu-ray and not only is
this one i've never even heard of i
never even noticed it on our shelf
before
but then they announced it and i looked
over and i said oh we have grave secrets
hobgoblins which i don't think we're
ever going to do because of mystery
science theory
mystery science theater mystery sign
mystery side mystery
behind me is the wall for uh action
which is
what we've discovered in reorganizing
things that's what we get the most of we
have uh more action than i think we do
of anything else
jungle raiders is one that stands out
just because we've had it forever
here we have a breakaway with tanya
harding
i guess they tried to make her an action
star that you know what i get i handed
to that woman
she has spun a felony into a career
not many people can get away with that
so sci-fi
horror action and then we have another
wall for kind of miscellaneous
which is mostly children's films
your dramas your children's movies your
comedies baby geniuses anything that
doesn't fit
in another category there's some
animated crap on here one area that we
don't
separate genres is our dvds
i i don't know why i think it's actually
less organized than it used to be i
think these are sorted by uh genre
this one these are part of the main
walls out there
did we have dvds with the vhs at one
point look at the bottom shelf
we started running out of room so we
built more shelves in here
all the dvds just got moved over and the
vision of genres just got lost
over here on this shelf a smaller shelf
we've got the multi-movie packs this is
where you know the
you see at walmart like five ten
years ago
50 science fiction movies for 10 bucks
and they're all garbage
we didn't find suburban sasquatch that
way and len kabzinski
so something we haven't done until very
recently is actually
cataloging all the movies we have all of
these tapes and uh we've recently found
a way to
organize them so you know we know what
we have because there's just
so much you could never keep track
of it all so this is we didn't find a
way we just finally
took the time to do it we finally took
the time to do it we have everything
separated by a genre but it's still a
lot of stuff to sift through
if we get a new tape and we're like oh
do we already have this i don't know so
we just shove it up on the shelf
we have this program clz movies and
you just take your phone that's got the
the app installed
line it up just the camera recognizes
that there's a bar code on it
and here it is magical legend of
leprechauns this movie is now screened
into our database this is our our
current project add the collection done
and i can click here i could search for
well you got to sync it first
i got to sync it first how do i i have
to sync it
what the update
windows windows update oh my god what's
up windows
keep the little ones safe check out our
blog
what's going on
okay uh this shelf is our
nightmare and it's always a mess because
for the wheel
i actually tried to screen tapes out
just
just to get rid of stuff that's complete
garbage invariably when mike and jay are
looking for wheel selections for an
episode they'll just take and
they'll move them
anywhere and i never
know what's been pre-screened and what's
not been
pre-screened then for a while we had
black spine it's just garbage
here's some notes if you want to send us
a wheel tape
don't send well-produced exercise tapes
if you see the jane fonda workout or
richard simmons sweating to the oldies
we're never gonna watch those
if you send us an exercise tape there's
actually a 90
chance i'm going to toss it sight unseen
i'm not even going to watch that
sos we did because it was bizarre
send us something where the production
is bizarre here's another secret
if you send me a tape and it's not good
enough for wheel of the worst usually
it's like a tape where it's
there's one funny aspect of the tape but
it's like
we're not going to put it on the wheel
if your tape is just
one joke is all we can make out of it
like this one thing's funny
i'll just i'll just peel off the
label on the spine that goes on the
black spine
shelf i think we've actually gone
through all of the good black spines
they're all gone we just filmed the
100th uh episode of best of the worst i
think
the good black spines are actually on
the
shelf downstairs where we film but when
we filmed those shows
it was only half full with the good
black spines
so we mixed in bad black spines and now
i no longer know
what shelves have the good black spines
and wood shelves have
the bad black spine tapes so i'm gonna
have to re-screen all of that
so that's our collection we're
constantly overwhelmed with how much we
have
the day may come when all these shelves
are completely filled
and we've run out of room and when that
day comes
i think we'll just set the building on
[Music]
fire
and then uh over here uh we've just got
some blank shelves
you know just future proofing someday we
could expand into this
but you know right now there's just
nothing on this shelf
