MIKE:
Hello, I'm Mike.

JAY:
And I'm Jay.

MIKE:
And today, we're here to tell you about our Patreon.

JAY:
That's right, Mike.
It's been a while since we've talked about it, so why not?

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
And in case you didn't know, Patreon is a tiered subscription site that we're a part of, where you can access exclusive RLM content.
Like text updates about what we're working on, what we're shooting, maybe even what our next video's coming out, and even movie recommendations.

JAY:
Why?

MIKE:
We see a lot of movies, Jay.
Sometimes we don't make review videos for all of them.

JAY:
Why not?

MIKE:
Aughhhh!

JAY:
Yeah.
We also post behind the scenes photos, artwork, and weird things that even weirder people send us.
Why would anyone send us this?

MIKE:
Or this?
Why would you send us that?

JAY:
Why did someone send us this?

MIKE:
What are we going to do with this?

JAY:
Why would we take a photo of it and publicly let people know that we now have that in our possession?

MIKE:
Why did I drop out of medical school?
And most importantly, outtakes from all of our shows.
The night would always end with Suburban Sasquatch.

JAY:
Well, but I'm saying how we discovered it, though, was we would just, like, we'd watch ten minutes of one of these movies.

MIKE:
Did you want a copy of Vampire Assassin?
We have several of them.
It ate your face.
But it looked like a giant piece of greasy bacon on a string.
BOING!
BOING!
It would fly around.

RICH:
Oh.
I am double-parked.
But the reason Mr. Plinkett is immortal.
Oh.

MIKE:
Not to mention behind the scenes videos, too.
Like this one that we just posted.
It's about how Rich Evans built the Best of the Worst table.
And it's fascinating.
So come on over and check out our Patreon page.
The link is posted below.
Or don't check it out.
That's fine, too.
We'll still be uploading our videos to YouTube.

JAY: 
Yeah.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Um, I don't really have anything else to say, so here's the end of Blood Debts.

MIKE:
I wonder which will be...the Best of the Worst?

MACAULAY:
Bwum-bwum-bwummmmmmm!
