MIKE:
Whoa!

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Uh, sorry.
I was just riding in on my Space Cop skateboard.

MIKE:
Oh, that's neat.

JAY:
Yeah.
Look at the back there.

MIKE:
That's really great.

JAY:
Yeah.
Original artwork.

MIKE:
Wow.
Oh, hi internets.
I'm Mike.

JAY:
And I'm Jay.

MIKE:
And we're making this video today to tell
you about The Great Red Letter Media Auction, which is happening right now.
The link is in the description below.

JAY:
That's right, Mike.
And all proceeds from this auction will go to charity.
That's not true at all.
I'm just kidding, of course.
All the proceeds from this auction will go to help funding our next feature film, Space Cop.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.
So you can bid on our props, scripts, and collectibles that we've used in our productions.
And own a piece of some kind of history.

JAY:
Yes.
And, uh, if you're not interested in owning any of our old crap, our website does have a donate button.
Right up at the top there.

MIKE:
That's right, Jay.

JAY:
Oh, so  maybe we should tell people what the fuck Space Cop is.

MIKE:
Oh, yes.
Space Camp is going to be a feature-length science fiction comedy film starring Rich Evans as a cop from the future...

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Of space.
Um, we tried before to make this movie.
You may have seen the trailer.

VOICEOVER:
A cop out of time.
Out of place.
In a world he didn't understand.

SPACE COP:
Thankless fucking job.

VOICEOVER:
His name?
Space Cop.

MIKE:
Uh, we tried to make this movie a number of years back, and it was a complete disaster.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Um, people didn't show up to shoot when they said they would.
Uh, we lost locations that we thought we had, and everything just sort of fell apart disastrously.
Uh, culminating in, uh, Rich Evans having a horrible allergic reaction to a cat.

SPACE COP:
This is my most treasured possession.

JAY:
So people may be wondering what items do we have on our auction.

MIKE:
A picture of me.

JAY:
Some creatures from our film, Feeding Frenzy.

MIKE:
Reckless, by Beth Henderson.

JAY:
The Night Court VHS tape.
Night Court not guaranteed.

MIKE:
A Chunky's Chicken box.

JAY:
A poster from a film we had nothing to do with.

MIKE:
Mr. Plinkett's comedy club sign.

JAY:
Mr. Plinkett's Star Wars Episode III and Cop Dog review scripts.

MIKE:
A science fiction device.

JAY:
And Kevin Bacon.

MIKE:
Do you remember that?

VOICEOVER:
Space Cop.

MIKE:
Jay, there's something else we should mention, too.
In addition to the props that we're auctioning off, we also have 50 beer bottles from the Half of the Bag set that we've, uh, attached to plaques and little stands and signed so you can, you can also, uh, bid on those.
There's going to be exactly 50 of them, individually numbered, and, uh, we created those ourselves as a, as a collectible item from the Half in the Bag series.
So, yeah.
Check out our ebay auction page.
Uh, the link is in the description below.
Uh, it's gonna be going on this week, probably into next week, as well.

JAY:
Yeah.
We're gonna be adding stuff here and there throughout the rest of the auction.
New items.
Fun surprises coming up.
But, Mike.
I think the real question that people might have is,
"When is the next Plinkett review going to be out?"

MIKE:
I don't know Jay.
I guess we'll find out.
Ow!
My eye!
Ow!
